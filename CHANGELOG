# Changelog

## 1.0.0

Initial version

## 1.1.0

Add in-memory cache to speed up successive calls to methods that generate the virtual pages.

## 1.1.1

Fix bug when some virtual pages lack translations.
More context: https://forum.getkirby.com/t/multilang-virtual-pages-particular-page-not-translated-howto/26510/12
Currently not 100% fixed (it only solves the hard error in Kirby), as it's unable to check if a virtual page has a content translation via `$contentTranslation->exists()`. Now defaults back to showing default language in this scenario (duplicate content issues are a risk).
